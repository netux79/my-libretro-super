# OUTPUT AND LOGGING
# ==================
#
# This is kind of an inline design document that'll be changed for basic user
# instructions when the logging system is finished and tested.
#
# libretro-super has two kinds of output, the basic kind showing what the
# script is doing in a big-picture sense, and the commands and output from
# individual commands.  End-users don't necessarily need to see this more
# detailed output, except when we're talking about huge cores like mame.
#
# If each can be directed to null, to the screen, to a log file, or to both
# the screen and a log file, you end up with a matrix os 16 possibilities.  Of
# those, only a few are truly useful:
#
# 	Basic		Detailed		Useful to
#	screen	screen		developer/end-user w/ space issues
#	screen	both			developer
#	both		both			developer
#	screen	log			end-user
#	log		log			buildbot
#
# What this tells me is that we need to log by default, as long as we kill
# old logfiles to avoid filling your HD with gigabytes of mame build logs.
# Output should go to both screen and log for developers, but users don't need
# to see the make commands, etc.  Being able to disable both would be useful,
# but that a near-term TODO item.  That just leaves being able to squelch the
# screen output for buildbot usage, and that's just > /dev/null on the command
# line, so not our problem here.
#
# Again, the ability to turn OFF these logs will be wanted very soon.

# Uncomment this to avoid clobbering logs
#LIBRETRO_LOG_APPEND=1

# Change this to adjust where logs are written
#LIBRETRO_LOG_DIR="$WORKDIR/log"

# Change this to rename the libretro-super main log file
#LIBRETRO_LOG_SUPER="libretro-super.log"

# Change this to rename core log files (%s for core's "safe" name)
#LIBRETRO_LOG_CORE="%s.log"

# Comment this if you don't need to see developer output
LIBRETRO_DEVELOPER=1


# BUILD_REVISIONS
# ===============
#
# libretro-super can save a revision string (e.g., the git sha hash) for any
# core it has compiled.  If this feature is enabled, it will check if the
# revison string has changed before it compiles the core.  This can speed up
# the build process for end-users and buildbots, and it also results in nightly
# build directories being smaller.  It is not enabled by default because it
# cannot know about uncommitted changes in a working directory.

# Set this to enable the feature
#SKIP_UNCHANGED=1

# Set this if you don't like the default
#BUILD_REVISIONS_DIR="$WORKDIR/build-revisions"


# COLOR IN OUTPUT
# ===============
#
# If you don't like ANSI-style color in your output, uncomment this line.
#NO_COLOR=1

# If you want to force it even in log files, uncomment this line.
#FORCE_COLOR=1

#USER DEFINES
#------------
#These options should be defined inside your own
#local libretro-config-user.sh file rather than here.
#The following below is just a sample.
